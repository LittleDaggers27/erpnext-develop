## Logo and Trademark Policy

The brand name Qunatum ERP and the logo are trademarks of Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd.

### Introduction

Frappe Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (Frappe) owns and oversees the trademarks for the Qunatum ERP name and logos. We have developed this trademark usage policy with the following goals in mind:

- We’d like to make it easy for anyone to use the Qunatum ERP name or logo for community-oriented efforts that help spread and improve Qunatum ERP.
- We’d like to make it clear how Qunatum ERP-related businesses and projects can (and cannot) use the Qunatum ERP name and logo.
- We’d like to make it hard for anyone to use the Qunatum ERP name and logo to unfairly profit from, trick or confuse people who are looking for official Qunatum ERP resources.

### Frappe Trademark Usage Policy

Permission from Frappe is required to use the Qunatum ERP name or logo as part of any project, product, service, domain or company name.

We will grant permission to use the Qunatum ERP name and logo for projects that meet the following criteria:

- The primary purpose of your project is to promote the spread and improvement of the Qunatum ERP software.
- Your project is non-commercial in nature (it can make money to cover its costs or contribute to non-profit entities, but it cannot be run as a for-profit project or business).
Your project neither promotes nor is associated with entities that currently fail to comply with the GPL license under which Qunatum ERP is distributed.
- If your project meets these criteria, you will be permitted to use the Qunatum ERP name and logo to promote your project in any way you see fit with one exception: Please do not use Qunatum ERP as part of a domain name.

Use of the Qunatum ERP name and logo is additionally allowed in the following situations:

All other Qunatum ERP-related businesses or projects can use the Qunatum ERP name and logo to refer to and explain their services, but they cannot use them as part of a product, project, service, domain, or company name and they cannot use them in any way that suggests an affiliation with or endorsement by Qunatum ERP or Frappe Technologies or the Qunatum ERP open source project. For example, a consulting company can describe its business as “123 Web Services, offering Qunatum ERP consulting for small businesses,” but cannot call its business “The Qunatum ERP Consulting Company.”

Similarly, it’s OK to use the Qunatum ERP logo as part of a page that describes your products or services, but it is not OK to use it as part of your company or product logo or branding itself. Under no circumstances is it permitted to use Qunatum ERP as part of a top-level domain name.

We do not allow the use of the trademark in advertising, including AdSense/AdWords.

Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial activity around Qunatum ERP. We encourage Qunatum ERP-based businesses, and we would love to see hundreds of them.

When in doubt about your use of the Qunatum ERP name or logo, please contact Frappe Technologies for clarification.
